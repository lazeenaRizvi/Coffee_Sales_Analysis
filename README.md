**Impact:**  
The Coffee Sales Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of business performance, enabling stakeholders to identify trends,
understand customer behavior, and make data-driven decisions. It is an essential tool for optimizing operations, 
tailoring marketing strategies,
and improving profitability in the coffee industry.
